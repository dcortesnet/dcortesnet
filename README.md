# Hi, I'm Diego 👋💻

Self-taught in the new technologies of the market, leaving a little behind the old school of traditional methodologies, I look for feedback day by day and I consider myself a structured person.
My strengths are the programming in the Python with Javascript languages. Complementing my programming work with mathematics and the modeling of UML diagrams.
